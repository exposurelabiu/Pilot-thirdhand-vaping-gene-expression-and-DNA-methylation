# Pilot-thirdhand-vaping-gene-expression-and-DNA-methylation
A pilot study on assessing the impact of thirdhand vaping exposures on lung and liver gene expression and DNA methylation in a mouse model.
Github files are available for the DNA methylation analysis. Gene expression and DNA methylation data are available on GEO and below are the accession numbers.

RNA-seq series: GSE288535
RRBS series: GSE288536

SuperSeries : GSE288642 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE288642)
Umbrella Bioproject: PRJNA1218776

For the files here on github,
Liver and Lung individual CpG site data are provided, as well differentially methylated regions (DMRs) that were statistically significant between thirdhand vape exposed and control (unexposed) mice.
Topp Gene results for the methylation are also provided
Additionally, scripts for the methylation analysis can be found in folder called 'for github'
